# Ecological_delimitation_of_the_Choco_region
We present a new ecological delimitation of the Choc√≥ region, integrating climatic and altitudinal data from Google Earth Engine. This new area includes a contiguous life zone of wet forest in southern Panama, the Colombian Pacific, the humid system of the Magdalena River in northern Colombia, and northern Ecuador.
