# Ecological_delimitation_of_the_Choco_region
We present a new ecological delimitation of the Choc√≥ region, integrating climatic and geographical data from  Google Earth Engine. This area includes geographically contiguous and climatically similar rainforests in southern Panama, the Colombian Pacific, the humid system of the Magdalena River in northern Colombia, and northern Ecuador.
